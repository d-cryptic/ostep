# OSINT: Operating Systems Implementation and Theory

A comprehensive collection of implementations, solutions, and educational materials based on the "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" (OSTEP) textbook by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau.

## Introduction

This repository contains practical implementations, homework solutions, and deep-dive explorations of fundamental operating systems concepts. Each chapter's content includes:

- **Code implementations** in Rust, C, Python, and assembly
- **Detailed explanations** and documentation  
- **Solution walkthroughs** for textbook problems
- **Performance analysis** and benchmarking tools
- **Educational examples** demonstrating core OS principles

The goal is to bridge theory and practice, providing hands-on experience with operating systems concepts while maintaining academic rigor and real-world applicability.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd osint

# Example: Run lottery scheduling demo
cd 09-scheduling-proportional-share/lottery_scheduling_decision
cargo run

# Example: Measure system call overhead
cd 04-limited-directed-execution/measurement/measurement_code
cargo run --release

# Example: Test scheduler performance
cd 07-scheduling-intro
python scheduler.py -p RR -l 50,100,150 -c
```

### Building All Projects
```bash
# Build all Rust projects
find . -name "Cargo.toml" -execdir cargo build \;

# Run all tests
find . -name "Cargo.toml" -execdir cargo test \;
```

## Project Structure

Each directory follows a consistent structure:
```

## Summary

This repository transforms the theoretical knowledge from "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" into practical, runnable code. Whether you're a student learning operating systems concepts, an educator looking for teaching materials, or a practitioner wanting to understand OS internals, these implementations provide a solid foundation for exploration and learning.

The code demonstrates not just *how* operating systems work, but *why* they work that way, with performance measurements, comparative analysis, and real-world considerations that bridge the gap between academic theory and practical implementation.

Key highlights include:
- **Complete scheduler implementations** (FIFO, SJF, RR, MLFQ, Lottery, Stride)
- **Performance measurement tools** for system calls and context switches
- **Multi-CPU scheduling** with cache affinity considerations
- **Assembly-level context switching** from xv6 operating system
- **Comprehensive documentation** with examples and analysis
